# Deep Learning Course on Cousera

### <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning" style="text-decoration:none">Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI</a><br>
Instructor: Andrew Ng

Here are the homeworks from deep learning course specialization on Coursera.<br>
I save those files for me to record some important topics and be able to review the implementations whenever I need.

## Brief Course Review
As an self-learner of deep learning, these courses help me a lot. Comparing with the machine learning courses from [Hsuan-Tien Lin](https://www.youtube.com/user/hsuantien/feed) and [Hung-yi Lee](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2ggjtuuWvxrHHHiaDH1dlQ), which focus on the mathematics and various techniques respectively, this specialization go through the problems you might face when implementing deep learning models, such as adjusting parameters, changing the architecture, and so on. It is also a wonderful introduction due to the first course, which help us to build the shallow neural network from scratch. After that, we know how to improve the performance in the second and third courses. Finally, the fourth and fifth course teach us variation of neural networks, convolution neural networks and sequence models. <br>
<br>
Most of these assignments are some practice when implementing various deep neural network, including CNN, LSTM and other architectures. However, these are just part of deep learning course, and I strongly suggest that you should go through the entire course and learn the detail of mathematics and concepts behind these topics. <br>
